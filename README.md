# MagicNumbersSolver
Python solver for MagicNumbers (or Mastermind if you change the length of the input)

1. Download the .py file
2. Adjust the `NUM_OF_DIGITS` variable. This changes the possible digits an input can take.
3. Adjust the `REPS` to change how many tests will be run.
4. Run the script (with pypy preferably) and watch your CPU melt
